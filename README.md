# PyBer_Analysis is a study of ride sharing data from Urban, Suburban, and Rural city types.

## Deliverable 1 is a tabular display that shows: "Total Rides", "Total Drivers", "Total Fares", "Average Fare per Ride", and "Average Fare per Driver" for the Urban, Suburban, and Rural city types.

  1.  The "Urban" city type has the highest numbers of "Total Rides", "Total Drivers", and "Total Fares" but the lowest "Average Fare per Ride" and "Average Fare per Driver." 
  2.  The "Rural" city type has the lowest numbers of "Total Rides", "Total Drivers", and "Total Fares" but the highest "Average Fare per Ride" and "Average Fare per Driver."
  3.  The "Suburban" city type shows all corresponding values falling between those of the "Urban" and "Rural" city types.

## Deliverable 2 is a line chart display that shows the "Total Fares (Weekly) by City Type" for the "Urban", "Suburban", and "Rural" city types.
  1.  The "Urban" city type has the highest "Total Fare by City Type" and the "Rural" city type has the lowest "Total Fare by City Type."
  2.  The "Suburban" city type has "Total Fare by City Type" values that fall between those of the "Urban" and "Rural" city types.

## Deliverable 1 "Total Fares" and Deliverable 2 "Total Fare by City Type" show corresponding patterns.

## Recommendations
  1.  Determining the weekly or monthly "Average Total Fares per Driver" would provide driver revenue information.
  2.  Determining the weekly or monthly "Average Total Expense per Driver" such as gas, oil changes, brakes, and depreciation would provide driver cost information.
  3.  Determine "Average Profit per Driver" to see if business model is sustainable. Then increase or decrease the number of drivers accordingly.
